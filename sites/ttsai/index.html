              <h1>About Netflix</h1>
              <p>Netflix, Inc. is an American over-the-top media services provider, headquartered in Los Gatos, California. Founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California, the company's primary business is its subscription-based streaming service, which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs including those produced in-house.</p>
              <h3>History of Netflix</h3>
              <p>Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail, although Hastings jettisoned DVD sales about a year after Netflix's founding to focus on the DVD rental business. In 2007, Netflix expanded its business with the introduction of streaming media, while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray rental service. The company expanded internationally, with streaming made available to Canada in 2010 and continued growing its streaming service from there; by January 2016, Netflix services operated in over 190 countries â€“ it is available worldwide except Mainland China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.</p>

              <p>Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2012, debuting its first series, Lilyhammer. It has greatly expanded the production of both film and television series since then, offering <span class="greentext">Netflix Original</span> content through its online library of films and television. Netflix released an estimated 126 original series or films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.</p>
